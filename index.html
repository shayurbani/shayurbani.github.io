    <p>One third of police departments in the United States, including the
       NYPD, have either adopted body cameras or are implementing body
       camera pilot programs, a technology that many policy makers are
       hoping is the answer to addressing police misconduct and increasing
       accountability. But some experts and community members are skeptical.</p>

       <blockquote class="rightquote">“What they’re doing, we believe, is not
       appropriate,” —Kumar Rao</blockquote>

    <p>The <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/about/about-nypd/equipment-tech/body-worn-cameras.page">
       NYPD pilot for body cameras</a>, which began last April as the direct
       result of a class action NYC residents filed against the police
       department for their practice of stop and frisk, has so far
       rolled out to 14 police precincts with the intent of equipping all
       officers with cameras by the end of 2019.</p>

    <p>At a town hall and panel discussion hosted by the Brooklyn chapter of
       the NAACP last week, Kumar Rao, senior staff attorney for racial
       justice at the <a href="https://populardemocracy.org/">Center for Popular Democracy</a>, said that although the
       body camera program was ordered as a way to improve relations between
       police officers and the communities they serve, the current program
       policy is deeply problematic. “What they’re doing, we believe, is not
       appropriate,” Rao said. “It’s not going to advance any of the reasons
       why they had to do the body camera proposal in the first place, which
       was to increase transparency, increase accountability, and to create
       a situation where we can have safer interactions between police and
       citizens.”</p>


       <blockquote class="leftquote">"There are times
       when an officer made an honest mistake and he thought a civilian being
       attacked was more important than turning on the camera,” —Sergeant Rudy
       Hall</blockquote>

    <p>One of the complaints that surfaced during the town hall was that the
       current policy gave too much discretionary power to
       officers to decide when they activated their cameras, and not enough
       discipline for officers who failed to comply with the activation guidelines.
       Sergeant Rudy Hall of the NYPD Compliance Division and adjunct
       professor at the <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a>, however, said
       that a strict disciplinary just does not make sense. "There are times
       when an officer made an honest mistake and he thought a civilian being
       attacked was more important than turning on the camera,” said Sergeant
       Hall. “Technically he violated our policy by not turning on the camera
       first, but I think that’s an honest mistake that most people can
       understand.</p>

    <p>Under the current body camera policy, officers are instructed to record
       the following situations: all uses of force, arrests, and property
       searches; when responding to a crime in progress; when patrolling
       inside a New York Housing Authority building; when transporting persons
       to a police station, hospital, or jail; and when interacting with
       “emotionally disturbed” persons. Officers are also allowed to record
       anytime they believe it would be useful, and they are encouraged, but
       not required, to inform individuals that recording is in progress</p>

    <p>Jamal Akbar, Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee of the Brooklyn
       NAACP, says that the organization's current stance is that “the policies
       do not represent the needs of the community” in terms of officer
       discretion to activate the cameras. In an official statement, the
       chapter encourages the NYPD to adopt cameras that are motion activated
       by external stimuli and contain signals that automatically advise the
       public when they begin recording. </p>
