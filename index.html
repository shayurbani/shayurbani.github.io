    <p> The definition of terrorism is widely contested by both politicians and scholars, and a common argument nowadays is that mass shootings in the U.S are too often not included in the definition when they are committed by white, non-Muslim actors. Instead of taking a position on this argument, I compared data sets of "terror attacks," as definied by the University of Maryland's Global Terror Database, and "mass shootings," as definied by Mass Shooting Tracker, to see what the quantifiable and geographic similarites and differences might exist between these types of events as they are interpreted by two reputable sources.
    <p>The map below depicts the number of people killed in terror attacks in the United States between 2013 and 2016, according to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD defines terrorism this way: “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic. religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.”  If you scroll over each incident. you can also view how many people were injured. </p>

    <p> “The map shows 147 terror attacks total. Geographically, these attacks were concentrated on the East Coast and in the Southeast, with notable exceptions in San Bernardino, California and West, Texas. The non-coastal western United States is strikingly void of incidents. </p>
    
    <p> The deadliest attacks are represented by larger, darker circles on the map. The top four were Orlando, Florida (50 dead), San Bernardino, California (16), West , Texas (15), and Charleston, South Carolina (9). </p>
    
    <p>The graph below depicts the number of people killed in mass shootings in the United States during the same time period, 2013-2016. There are 1,513 incidents total, a substantially larger number than that of terror attacks. </p>

    <pThe data above was taken from Mass Shooting Tracker (as featured in the Washington Post), which defines mass shootings in this way:  “a mass shooting is an incident where four or more people are shot in a single shooting spree. This may include the gunman himself, or police shootings of civilians around the gunman</p>

    <p>It’s worth noting that this is different from the FBI definition of “mass murder” or “mass shooting,” which is when four or more people are killed in one event. Mass Shooting Tracker argues that the FBI term is not a good proxy for quantifying mass gun violence, since many people who are victims of shootings survive. For example, if 25 people are shot by a gunman, but only two people die, this would not be considered — under the FBI definition — as a “mass shooting.”  Under Mass Shooting Tracker’s definition, it would be. </p>
    
    <p>As with terror attacks, mass shootings are concentrated on the East Coast and in the Southeast, but there are many incidents on the West Coast and in the Midwest as well. Also like terror attacks, there are very few mass shootings in the non-coastal western United States.</p>
    
    <p> The deadliest shootings were Orlando, Florida (50 dead), San Bernardino, California (16), Rosebug, Oregon (10), and Waco, Texas (9) </p>
