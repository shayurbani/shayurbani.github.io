    <p>Comedians who have been performing in Brooklyn for years say that the scene is getting more diverse.
      But what does the data show?.</p>

   

    <p>Earlier this month I spoke to comedian Calvin Cato, who has been performing and hosting shows in Brooklyn
      for 11 years. Cato says that there’s a much wider ranges of voices on stage now than there used to be:
      more women, more people of color, and more lgbt comics are performing and getting stage-time. 
      “There’s so much more awareness of the importance of diversity in comedy,” Cato said, “and there’s
      interest in supporting different voices.”.</p>

    <p>So I decided to look at one demographic -- women -- and see if this was true.</p>

    <p>“Comedy at The Knitting Factory” in Williamsburg and “The Fancy Show” in Park Slope are both popular, 
      weekly shows that regularly pack a full house and, most importantly, post their featured comics each week on twitter.</p>

    <p>Here’s what stage-time for female comedians looked like in 2015. The numbers represent percentages, so if one night 
      there were five comics performing and two of those comics were women, we could say that 0.4 or 40% of that line-up was female. </p>

    <p>As one can see from the data, it was very rare in 2015 to have a 50-50 men to women lineup at either of these venues.
      At The Fancy Show, it only happened once in my dataset, on November 10h. Note that for this exercise, I only recorded 
      the data for every other month in 2015--so roughly half of the shows that year.</p>

    <p>And here’s what stage-time looked like for female comics this year. </p>
